# Women4Women
>This project is a collaborative effort by the members of Group 1 (The Codeblazers) from the Woman Techsters cohort 2.4 bootcamp organized by tech4dev.
## About the project
Women for Women is founded on Sustainable Development Goal 5- Gender 
Equality; which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all girls and women.
Spurring from our motivation and determination as a team of women, the project will 
encompass;
* Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and 
well-being for all ages, and
* Sustainable Development Goal 4, which aims at ensuring inclusive and 
equitable education, while promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.
In line with the aforementioned goals, we will channel our resources and abilities towards women in particular.
